            scales of reality through sound. Experience the uncertainty-principle-defying
            premiere of "QUARK QUARTET," utilizing instruments smaller than atoms that generate
            probabilities rather than definite notes, creating music that changes when observed
            directly. The program manipulates fundamental forces with compositions including
            "STRING THEORY SONATA" (employing 11-dimensional harmonics), "PARTICLE WAVE DUALITY
            DANCE" (where each note simultaneously behaves as a discrete tone and a continuous
            frequency), and "QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT ETUDE" (creating paired sounds that
            instantaneously affect each other regardless of distance). The evening concludes
            with "UNIFIED FIELD SYMPHONY"—a composition theoretically linking all four
            fundamental forces through acoustic principles. Size-altering technology
            temporarily reduces audience members to quantum scale for optimal listening
