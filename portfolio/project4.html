      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>This was a pretty simple project for a course where we had to create an informative poster for an existing product.</p> 
      <p>Interestingly, when we had time to work on this project, my laptop froze, and I couldn't use Photoshop. So, I resorted to using Google Drawings. I knew Google Drawings isn't a professional, high-quality platform, but for this project, the design and layout were what mattered.</p> 
      <p>I used the masking tool on my Apple iPhone to remove the background from photos I took myself, and I did my best to make Google Drawings work for this assignment. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out, given my resources and time constraints.</p> 
      <p>You may notice the reference to Jeremy Allen White, which I feel needs explaining. My group in this class decided at the beginning of the semester to somehow reference Jeremy Allen White or his various projects in *all* of our submissions. This extra challenge served as a good icebreaker in class discussions and genuinely challenged us to create more interesting work. It was a great opportunity to put in a little more effort by stretching the rules of the original assignment.</p>
